# Exploratory Data Analysis

Howdy,

The dataset I used for EDA contains information related to various factors that can influence an individual's likelihood of developing coronary heart disease (CHD).In the field of public health, it is of the utmost importance to recognize and forecast CHD risk since early intervention and detection can greatly minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.By analyzing and modeling this data, we can gain insights into the factors contributing to CHD risk and help healthcare professionals develop better strategies for prevention and intervention.

Goal: The primary goal of this analysis is to explore the relationship between smoking habits, health variables (BMI, heart rate), and coronary heart disease risk, while also comparing heart rates between smokers and non-smokers, in order to better understand the impact of smoking on cardiovascular health.

Here are the questions I addressed during the analysis: 

1) 

A) How many smokers fall into each age group?
B) What percentage of individuals within each age category are smokers?
C) How does the average number of cigarettes smoked by individuals within each age group compare?

2)  Is there a relationship between the

A) Number of Cigarettes and BMI
B) Number of Cigarettes and diaBP
C) Number of Cigarettes and CHD Risk
D) Determining whether individuals with a high CHD risk or those with no risk smoke more cigarettes

3) Does smoking have a noticeable impact on heart rates in comparison to non-smokers?

In the field of public health and clinical research, understanding the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) is of paramount importance for early detection and intervention. This dataset presents a valuable opportunity to investigate the complex interplay of various factors, including demographic characteristics, behavioral habits, and medical history, in determining the 10-year risk of developing CHD. By analyzing this dataset, I aim to gain insights into the patterns and predictors of CHD risk, which can contribute to the development of more effective preventive strategies and personalized healthcare interventions. It would be interesting and helpful to find out CHD Risk and factors which can cause CHD, ultimately working towards a future where fewer individuals are affected by this debilitating condition.

Thank you!
